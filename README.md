## The air levitator system

The air levitator allows to perform a variety of control engineering experiences with a fast dynamics system. The whole setup consists, basically, on a light ball, a tube, a fan to create the air flow inside the tube that will levitate the ball, a servo that moves a flap for introducing perturbations, and the required sensors to measure both the position of the levitating ball and the air speed.

The air levitator system can be used as a hands-on traditional laboratory or as a remote lab through the included web application. The equipment also comes with a web simulation of the system that allows performing lab activities in a virtual way.

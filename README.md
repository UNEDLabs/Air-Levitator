## The air levitator system

The air levitator allows to perform a variety of control engineering experiences with a fast dynamics system. The whole setup consists, basically, on a light ball, a tube, a fan to create the air flow inside the tube that will levitate the ball, a servo that moves a flap for introducing perturbations, and the required sensors to measure the position of both the levitating ball and the air speed.
